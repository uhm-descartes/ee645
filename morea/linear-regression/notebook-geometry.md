# Geometry of Linear Regression

The first part of this
[notebook](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/ee445/morea/linear-regression/module-lr-notebook.ipynb)
runs you through the basics of linear regression. It is useful to be
familiar with linear spaces and the four fundamental linear spaces
associated with any matrix covered in EE 345, but the notebook has a
quick summary of the relevant linear spaces.

## Submission Instructions

This section has three problems. Please turn in the solved notebook on Laulima.
