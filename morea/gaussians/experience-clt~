The Central Limit Theorem (Berry-Essen bounds) posits that the sum of
independent, identically distributed random variables $X_1,\ldots,
X_n$ with finite third moment is distributed with a pdf that is very
close to that of a Gaussian random variable, no matter what the
distribution of $X_i$ is.  $X_i$ could be continuous or discrete (as
long as they have finite third moment).

This means that while $\sum X_i$ is a random variable, its
distribution is predictable, and is approximately Gaussian. We could
therefore answer questions like, what is the probability $\sum X_i >
a$ or for an appropriate set $A$, what is the probability $\sum X_i
\in A$.

Regarding the last line, there is a wealth of theory there. What sort
of a set $A$ can we have? The central limit theorem is a special case
of a larger set of results called the Laws of Large Numbers, or
deviation inequalities. It is also why we often choose to model
certain kinds of noise (either in measurements, or thermal noise) as
Gaussian---because such sources of noise are contributions from a
large number of small independent similar components (thermal noise is
vibrations of a large number of atoms).
