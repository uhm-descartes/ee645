The Central Limit Theorem (Berry-Essen bounds) posits that the sum of
independent, identically distributed random variables \\(X_1,\ldots,
X_n\\) with finite third moment is distributed with a pdf that is very
close to that of a Gaussian random variable, no matter what the
distribution of \\(X_i\)) is.  \\(X_i\\) could be continuous or discrete (as
long as they have finite third moment).

This means that while \\(\sum X_i\\) is a random variable, its
distribution is predictable, and is approximately Gaussian. We could
therefore answer questions like, what is the probability \\(\sum X_i >
a\\) or for an appropriate set \\(A\\), what is the probability \\(\sum X_i
\in A\\).

There is actually a wealth of ideas in the last line above. What sort of a set
\\(A\\) can we have? Look at the demo for an example of a set \\(A\\) for
which we cannot ask the question. This will lead to a story of topology,
and those interested can explore this in modules to come in future semesters,
or look at "Convergence of Probability Measures" by Patrick Billingsley (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics, 2nd edition).

The central limit theorem is a special case of a larger set of results
called the Laws of Large Numbers (LLNs), or deviation inequalities. It is
also why we often choose to model certain kinds of noise (either in
measurements, or thermal noise) as Gaussian---because such sources of
noise are contributions from a large number of small independent
similar components (thermal noise is vibrations of a large number of
atoms). There are many variations of such LLNs---the
central limit theorem is an example of what is called "convergence in
distribution". There are stronger versions of LLNs, you can explore them
in the module "Convergence of Random Variables", usually taught in EE 640.
