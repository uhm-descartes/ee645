  * You are able to build simple neural networks (feedforward/autoencoders) 
  * You are familiar with multivariate Taylor series, the gradient and the Hessian (see background if not)
  * You understand (at a high level) stochastic gradient descent, and its accelerations to replicate some second order behavior using past values of gradients
  * You can train networks using stochastic gradient descent/variants
  * You understand autoencoder architectures (linear activations) in relation to the singular value decomposition
  * You can train autoencoders to project training datasets to low dimensional (potentially non-linear) manifolds
