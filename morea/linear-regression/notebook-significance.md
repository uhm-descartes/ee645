# Geometry of Linear Regression

The second part of this
[notebook](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/ee445/morea/linear-regression/module-lr-notebook.ipynb)
lets you think critically about the geometry of linear regression, noting that
the training error is not the full picture. It goes through a validation perspective to find out about significance of features, and the LASSO approach towards
obtaining relevant, generalizable features.
