This module was also a warp-speed introduction to optimization, convex functions, and some linear algebra
in addition to kernel methods. You are done with this module when:

  * You can write out Lagrangians for constrained optimization
  * You understand primal and dual formulations (min-max and max-min) with Lagrangians
  * You can write out the Support vector classification formulations, both in the linearly separable and non-linearly separable case
  * You understand SVC formulations as the hinge loss with \\(\ell_2\\) penalty view
  * You understand quadratic forms and positive definite matrices 
  * You understand positive definite kernels and the kernel lifting
  * You understand introducing non-linearities in algorithms that only depend on dot products using kernel lifting
