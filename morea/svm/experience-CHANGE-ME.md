# Run and interpret the support vector machine via scikit-learn

The following python
[notebook](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/ee445/morea/svm/svm.ipynb)
walks you through building a Support Vector Classifier on scikit
learn.  You have already built the support vector classifier in the
Single Neuron Networks module as a single neuron network, learning
with stochastic gradient descent. The support vector classifier from
scikit learn is optimized not as stochastic gradient descent, but as
a gradient descent on the true dual objective. 

In addition to running the code, extract the values of the Lagrangian.
Now go through Section 2.2 of the [Reading](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/ee445/morea/svm/svm-dual-general.pdf)
and see if you can interpret the values of the Lagrangian properly,
in addition to verifying the points there.
