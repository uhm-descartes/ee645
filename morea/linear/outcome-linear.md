  * You understand the basic principles and visualizations behind linear regression and some classification approaches
  * You can multiply matrices, and interpret matrix multiplication as linear combinations (both row and column views)
  * You follow the idea of projections into linear spaces
  * You understand logistic regression through the probabilistic and maximum entropy lens

### Submissions required for this module
You have to submit at least one of the two assessments (the theory or
simulations). If you work on both, you will get a small prize in
addition! All submissions will be on Laulima.

* A detailed analysis of logistic regression as a maximum entropy approach is
[here](./logistic.pdf). The theory homework is based off this writeup (most of the solutions are already in the writeup, the few small details need to be filled up).  

* We did a demo with logistic regression and the weather [data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TvOiktbpG784mYLSRRjk6LULKVGECH3r?usp=sharing) on Jan 22. You will have to implement the same in your simulation homework. In addition, you have to build a single neuron network that simulates linear regression (ordinary least squares as well as regularized linear regression).
