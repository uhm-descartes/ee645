We will read the following
[paper](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/papers/em-uai.pdf) in class
together on low dimensional projections and EM. This is to illustrate
how to read ML papers for your research. This is short, well written,
has a nice result, gives good background and just challenging enough
that it is worth it.

A detailed presentation, with simulations, can be a choice for your final
project. You have to

1. Understand and summarize the mathematical details
2. Implement the algorithm on a dataset I will provide.
