The Spring 2025 edition welcomes students from multiple departments:
the traditional STEM departments of ECE, other engineering, Computer
Science, Astronomy, Math, SOEST and others, but also from other
departments such as (but not only limited to) economics, business and
urban planning. The course centers around a few topics that are
carefully selected, but which give students an opportunity to spin off
and pursue an angle that is best matched with their background and
research agendas.

Basic familiarity with statistics, some probability and linear
algebra, and programming is required, supplemented with a willingness
to learn fundamentals. Ideally, students should have had some exposure
to using machine learning/AI (even if it is only YouTube videos or
playing with them as black boxes). The goal is for all students to
pick up the central tenets of this field in a way that can guide them
to use AI/machine learning in a sophisticated and nuanced
fashion. You can take this course even if you have taken other ICS
courses on the topic, or if you have taken the large language models
course in the ECE department.

This course will also have _mentors_. Mentors are chosen from
students who have taken prior editions of the course. I hope you will
agree to mentor students down the line.

The course will be divided into several modules. There is no single
text for the course, but there are several excellent resources that
may serve you well beyond the course. Here is an (incomplete) list of
some of the sources we will use, almost all have legal online
versions.  That said, some of material in the class is quite new and
ongoing research, so I am not aware of textbooks, only technical
papers.

1. Dive into Deep Learning'': online book by Zhang et. al. available [here](https://d2l.ai)
2. Understanding machine learning: From Theory to Algorithms by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David, available [here](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf)
3. Patterns, Predictions and Actions'' by Moritz Hardt and Benjamin Recht, available [here](https://mlstory.org)
4. Learning theory from first principles by Francis Bach, available [here](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/ltfp_book.pdf)
5. Neural Network Learning: Theoretical Foundation by Martin Anthony and Peter Bartlett (an old but really good book). I don't know if there is an online version.

Modules will have assignments. Genera
