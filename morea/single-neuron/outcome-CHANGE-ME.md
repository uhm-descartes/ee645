  * Build and train a neuron on keras/tensorflow using stochastic gradient descent
  * Form an initial idea of Stochastic Gradient Descent using the example of Perceptron Learning Algorithm
  * Understand how the choice of activation/loss and regularization can replicate well known machine learning algorithsm
