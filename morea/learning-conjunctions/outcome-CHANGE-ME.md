  * Understand the purpose behind this formulation.
  * You should be able to set up a learning problem in the standard
probabilistic framework (which we will call Probably Approximately
Correct or PAC learning), specifically the notions of
\emph{confidence} and \emph{accuracy}.
  *  For the problem of learning conjunctions, you should
understand how to derive the PAC bound on the training sample, and
be able to work out similar bounds for simple problems.
