You can read this [book](https://www.amazon.com/Probably-Approximately-Correct-Algorithms-Prospering/dp/0465032710) for a nice context to this idea. Leslie Valiant, the author of the book above, is the person credited with developing some of the ideas (and as far as I know, the name) for machine learning.
