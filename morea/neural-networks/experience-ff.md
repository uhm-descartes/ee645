# MNIST Dataset

The following [notebook](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/ee445/morea/neural-networks/feedforward.ipynb) leads you through building and training a simple feedforward neural network, and allows you to classify handwritten digits in MNIST. In an assessment, you will repeat this on a similar, but more challenging datasets (CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST).
