## Welcome to ECE 645, Spring 2025

ECE 645 is an graduate level course in machine learning, and a foundational
course for graduate students who would like to use AI/machine learning
in their research.

Current students: please sign on to the class discord server [here](https://discord.gg/BeU63RnS).

## Who should take this course

The Spring 2025 edition welcomes students from multiple departments:
in addition to the traditional ECE, Computer Science, and other STEM
departments (ME, CEE, Math, Astronomy), we have students from social
sciences, public policy and business. Basic familiarity with
statistics, probability and some linear algebra, supplemented with a
willingness to learn fundamentals, is all that is required. Ideally,
students should have had some exposure to using machine learning/AI
(even if it is only YouTube videos or playing with them as black
boxes). The goal is for all students to pick up the central tenets of
this field in a way that can guide them to use AI/machine learning in
a sophisticated and nuanced fashion.

## Pedagogy

EE 645 is structured as a series of
[modules](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/ee645/modules), each taking
approximately 2-3 weeks to complete. Given the diversity of students,
we will tailor courses towards multiple categories of students
(theory, simulations, developing applications for non-traditional
areas). The course will operate in partially flipped mode, where we
will delegate some topics to recordings and use class time for threading
multiple perspectives together. 

Modules have:

  * [Prerequisites](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/ee645/prerequisites), describing skills you should have prior to starting the module.
  * [Learning outcomes](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/ee645/outcomes), describing the major goals for the module.
  * [Readings and other online resources](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/ee645/readings), providing background material.
  * [Experiential learning activities](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/ee645/experiences), providing a structured set of challenges enabling you to acquire mastery of material.
  * [Assessments](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/ee645/assessments), which help you determine if you have acquired mastery of the material.

## About the instructor

[Narayana Prasad Santhanam](https://ee.hawaii.edu/faculty/profile?usr=63) is a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Hawaii. My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning, information theory and statistics. A particular focus is on high dimensional and complex problems, that are not amenable to traditional statistical methods and guarantees.
