We will read the following
[paper](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/papers/em-uai.pdf) in class
together on low dimensional projections and EM. This is to illustrate
how to read ML papers for your research. This is short, well written,
has a nice result, gives good background and just challenging enough
that it is worth it. See the assessment where you will answer questions on
this and hopefully tell you how to look at these papers better.

A detailed presentation, with simulations, can be a choice for your final
project. If you do this, you will be

1. Understanding and summarizing the mathematical details
2. Implementing the algorithm on a dataset I will provide.
