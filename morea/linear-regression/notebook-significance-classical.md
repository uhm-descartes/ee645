# Geometry of Linear Regression

The third part of this
[notebook](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/ee445/morea/linear-regression/module-lr-notebook.ipynb)
takes you through a tour of the classical way of assessing
significance through \(t-\)tests. In machine learning applications
with a lot (sometimes millions) of features, these tests have limited
utility. If individual feature significances are to add up to
something meaningful over these numerous features, each significance
has to be really strong (its reciprocal must be two orders of
magnitude more than the number of features). Yet, the reasoning is 
very elegant, and will help you understand linear regression a lot
better.
