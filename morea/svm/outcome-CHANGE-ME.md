  * Understand how to set up the maximum margin classifier in the linearly separable case
  * Extend the linear separable case to non-linearly separable data
  * Understand the convex optimization setup, Lagrangians and the dual formulation
  * Appreciate the nature of solutions of the SVM:
	  * only certain examples (support vectors) determine the solution, identify these from Lagrange multipliers 
	  * Appreciate that the SVM formulation only deals with pairwise dot products among examples
  * Kernel trick that allows us to move from linear to non-linear classification boundaries in the example space
